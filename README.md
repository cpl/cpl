## Hi

‚ö°Ô∏è Quick things about me:
* Software Architect.
* Privacy and Security focused.
* A low-level enthusiast.
* Golang zealot.

üìú Tech journey:

It's impossible to cover everything I've learned in my amateur to professional journey.

* 2009: Started off programming in MS-DOS.
* 2011: Shifted then to the school mandated C++ (which was only covering C concepts in C++).
* 2012: Started my passion for Game development, learned Unity 3D with C# and did this for 2-3 years.
  * Around this time I began understanding the importance of standards and software development methods and techniques.
  * Did my fair share of graphics, 3d-modelling, animations and texturing.
  * Started learning and using Git in my projects
* 2014: Learned Python and believed it was the best thing since sliced bread.
  * Used Python as my primary language for everything for a good 2 years.
* 2015: Learning C, reverse engineering and computer networks on the side, nothing major (*yet*).
* 2015: Start playing with Raspberry PIs and sysadmin tasks on my own network.
  * Setup email, ftp, web, * servers just for fun and practice.
  * Setup my first Tor middle relay.
  * Learn proper GNU/Linux management.
  * I eventually install Arch as my main operating system and use that for over a year.
    * It all came burning down one day while doing a bleeding edge system update ... 10/10 will do again.
* 2016: Off to University for the next 3 years.
  * Really get into Computer Engineering and Architecture (low level stuff in Cadence and Assembly).
  * Give Golang a try, but I am too much of a Python fanboy.
  * A bunch of Hackathons happen, where I hone my skills.
  * Start getting into Security and Privacy, CTFs and more.
* 2017: Low-level galore.
  * Really go down the rabbit hole with Operating Systems low-level concepts.
  * Learn a lot and build a lot during my Microcontrollers course.
  * Realize the importance of typed, robust programming languages and force myself into learning Go.
    * Best decision ever.
* 2018: Begin my third year project, an Operating System.
  * Learn even more Assembly and low-level.
  * Advance my Go knowledge and Software Engineering in general.
  * Begin learning Docker and containerization technologies.
* 2019: Start working at THG (AppSec then Cloud team).
  * Write the first Go project in the AppSec team, proving to myself that Go works!
    * It works in terms of performance, code maintainability, and getting the job done.
  * Continue developing Go services, learning more about "industry" grade service architectures.
  * Really get a shift in views towards the direction of software.
  * Learn a bit of everything: DevOps, Networks, DBA, (ü©∏ OpenStack) and more.
* 2020: Quit, took a break, then joined QeOPS.
  * Built some of the best software I've ever built.
  * Major focus on simplicity, moving closer and closer to the [original UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
  * Started doing proper frontend.
  * Soon realize most web-devs are sheep and follow guides blindly, ending up with [200GB node_modules/](https://devhumor.com/content/uploads/images/August2017/node-modules.jpg), massive codebases from the start of the project and no understanding whatsoever of the underlying tech.

üí¨ Some of my views:
* Low-level programming and "computer science" concepts are important for every developer to understand.
  * Especially memory management which gets abstracted by most programming languages.
  * Software engineering culture doesn't help either, where "just add more RAM" is a viable solution.
* The "web" is a mess that will not go away in our lifetime.
  * So buckle up and make the best of HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and the festering cesspool of *big frameworks*‚Ñ¢.
  * It doesn't have to be so üí© and there are plenty of good reads on this: [link](https://www.planningforaliens.com/blog/2016/04/11/why-js-development-is-crazy/), [link](https://blog.plan99.net/its-time-to-kill-the-web-974a9fe80c89?gi=d28ac2580642), [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20201110091423/http://blog.spencermounta.in/2020/should-we-stop/index.html).
  * I myself try to avoid using npm, *big frameworks*‚Ñ¢ like React, Vue, Angular, *whatever.js* and instead try to keep things simple.
* Politics is crossing the **thin silicon line** into tech.
  * "Political correctness" for the sake of being "politically correct" is dumb.
  * Being *woke* doesn't solve problems or bring them to light.
